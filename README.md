# Advent-of-code-2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! This repo contains the solutions to the daily coding challenges provided during Advent of Code 2024.

Each day of the Advent of Code event, a new puzzle is unlocked, and this repository will contain my solutions to these challenges. The puzzles range in difficulty, and each day’s solution is implemented in JavaScript (or other languages depending on the challenge).

## About

Advent of Code is an annual event where a new puzzle is unlocked each day from December 1st to December 25th. These puzzles are a fun and engaging way to practice problem-solving and programming skills. The puzzles often involve algorithms, data structures, and mathematical problems, and they help me sharpen my coding abilities.

## How to Use

You can browse through the code for each day’s challenge by navigating to the respective day folders or files in this repository. Each day has its own subdirectory, with code and sometimes a detailed explanation of the solution.

### Example of the structure:

advent-of-code-2024/
├── day1/
│   ├── day1.js
├── index.html
├── proxy.mjs
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── README.md

## Installation
To run the code, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine.

#### Clone the repository :

- git clone https://github.com/BomberQLF/Advent-of-code-2024
- cd advent-of-code-2024

#### Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then run:

- npm install

#### Start the Server: Use the Express.js server (proxy.mjs) to run and test the code:

- node proxy.mjs

#### View in Browser: Open your browser and go to:

- http://localhost:3000

## Daily-challenges

- Each day’s solution is organized in its own folder (e.g., day1, day2, etc.), containing the relevant code files. The index.html serves as a starting point for running the solutions through a browser or an Express.js server configured via proxy.mjs.
